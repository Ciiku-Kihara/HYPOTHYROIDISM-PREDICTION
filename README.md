# HYPOTHYROIDISM-PREDICTION
The main goal of this project was to determine which classification models are able to predict whether a patient has hypothyroidism with the highest accuracy.

## Description
This repository contains a Jupiter notebook that contains Python code that I used to build various Machine Learning models.
The target variable in this case is status which gives information on whether a patient has hypothyroidism or not. I built models using
Random Forest, Ada boost, Gradient boost and SVM algorithms to find out which algorithm gives the highest prediction accuracy.
My findings are well explained in the notebook. You may jump right into the conclusions at the end of the notebook to get a summary of my findings.

## Experimental design
- Read and explore the given dataset
- Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question
- Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Build models using the following:
    * Random Forest
    * Adaboosted trees
    * Gradient Boost
    * Support Vector Machine 
- Challenge the solution.
- Make conclusions

## Setup Instructions
